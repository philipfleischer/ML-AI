# ML-AI (IN1160)

Introduction to **Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence** at the University of Oslo (UiO).
Course code: **IN1160**.

This repository contains my coursework, exercises, and projects from IN1160, with a focus on **practical machine learning**, experimental methodology, and responsible use of AI techniques using Python.

## Course Overview

IN1160 provides a foundational introduction to machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), with emphasis on **practical applications**, correct usage of existing ML methods, and **design and evaluation of experiments**.

The course covers:

- Supervised learning (regression and classification)
- Unsupervised learning (clustering)
- Reinforcement learning
- Neural networks and decision trees
- Experimental design and evaluation
- Ethical, philosophical, and historical perspectives on AI

Applications discussed include areas such as language technology, image processing, and robotics.
